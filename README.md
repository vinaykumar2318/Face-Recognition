# Face Recognition Project using LFW Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to perform face recognition on the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset using three different techniques: LBP (Local Binary Patterns), HoG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The LFW dataset is a popular benchmark for face recognition algorithms and contains images of faces collected from the web.

## Dataset
The LFW dataset contains more than 13,000 images of faces from various sources. It includes images of celebrities, politicians, athletes, and other public figures. Each image is labeled with the name of the person depicted.

## Techniques Used
1. **LBP (Local Binary Patterns):** LBP is a texture descriptor that is widely used in face recognition. It extracts texture information from images by comparing each pixel with its neighboring pixels and encoding the result into a binary pattern.
2. **HoG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients):** HoG is a feature descriptor that captures the local gradient information in an image. It computes histograms of gradient orientations in localized portions of an image, which are then used as features for classification.
3. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** CNNs are deep learning models that have shown remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, including face recognition. In this project, a CNN architecture is trained on the LFW dataset to learn discriminative features directly from the images.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Before using the dataset, it's important to preprocess the images by resizing them to a consistent size, normalizing pixel values, and potentially augmenting the data to increase the diversity of training examples.
2. **Feature Extraction:** For LBP and HoG, feature extraction involves computing the LBP patterns or HoG descriptors for each image in the dataset. These features are then used as input to train a machine learning model.
3. **Training:** Train separate models for each technique using appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM for LBP and HoG, CNN architecture for CNN).
4. **Testing and Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained models on a separate test set to assess their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
5. **Comparison:** Compare the performance of the three techniques in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to variations in lighting, pose, and facial expression.
